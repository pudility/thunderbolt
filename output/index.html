<p>Today is iPhone day for me. Most people got their iPhones last week, but last week I did not have the slightest idea I event wanted an iPhone. Before two days ago I had an android phone; More specifically I had the google pixel 2 xl, before that I had the original pixel and before that I had the onePlus. But my android stories are for another day. The reason I decided to switch to IOS is because of the iPhone X. My friend got one and let me use it - I immediately fell in love. I have a mac and an iPad, so IOS is not completely foreign to me. However I do not know all the ins and outs of the OS and I am <em>so</em> excited to learn more.</p>

<p>Yesterday my friend and I went to the apple store near my house. We got their an hour early and waited for the doors to open - it was definitely overkill but I was determined to buy the iPhone before anyone else who may have wanted it. Unfortunately they did not have any for iPhones available for walk-in purchase in order to prevent scalping (read more about that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2017/11/03/iphone-x-seattle/">here</a>). Then I tried several times to purchase it from the website and apple store app only to end up calling apple and purchasing it over phone. When I finally purchased it I was again disappointed to find out that the only &quot;trusted person&quot; (the only person that is allowed to pick up your iPhone) was not me, but my Verizon account manager. After calling apple twice and fiddling around with the terrible &quot;My Verizon&quot; app I was finally able to make myself the Account manager - Unfortunately this did not effect the name on the trusted persons list. At this point I was ever so slightly irritated, so I went home and canceled my order.</p>
<h3 id="today"><a class="header-link" href="#today"></a>Today</h3>
<p>Today I woke up at <code>5:45 AM</code> in order to be the first one to reserve the iPhone at the apple store <em>near my house</em> (not the one at South Center almost an hour away). Five minutes past six AM I completed my purchase of the iPhone X, Space gray, 64 GB <em>with</em> the apple upgrade program and apple care plus. I am going to pick it up this afternoon - wish me luck.</p>

<p>Lets start up this blog! This is the first post. Its mostly just a test. Later today I will write my <em>actual</em> first post. Just for kicks, here is a Steve Jobs quote:</p>

<p>Your time is limited, so don&#39;t waste it living someone else&#39;s life.</p>
