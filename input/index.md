# iPhone Day

Today is iPhone day for me. Most people got their iPhones last week, but last week I did not have the slightest idea I event wanted an iPhone. Before two days ago I had an android phone; More specifically I had the google pixel 2 xl, before that I had the original pixel and before that I had the onePlus. But my android stories are for another day. The reason I decided to switch to IOS is because of the iPhone X. My friend got one and let me use it - I immediately fell in love. I have a mac and an iPad, so IOS is not completely foreign to me. However I do not know all the ins and outs of the OS and I am *so* excited to learn more.

### Yesterday

Yesterday my friend and I went to the apple store near my house. We got their an hour early and waited for the doors to open - it was definitely overkill but I was determined to buy the iPhone before anyone else who may have wanted it. Unfortunately they did not have any for iPhones available for walk-in purchase in order to prevent scalping (read more about that [here](https://www.macrumors.com/2017/11/03/iphone-x-seattle/)). Then I tried several times to purchase it from the website and apple store app only to end up calling apple and purchasing it over phone. When I finally purchased it I was again disappointed to find out that the only "trusted person" (the only person that is allowed to pick up your iPhone) was not me, but my Verizon account manager. After calling apple twice and fiddling around with the terrible "My Verizon" app I was finally able to make myself the Account manager - Unfortunately this did not effect the name on the trusted persons list. At this point I was ever so slightly irritated, so I went home and canceled my order.

### Today

Today I woke up at `5:45 AM` in order to be the first one to reserve the iPhone at the apple store *near my house* (not the one at South Center almost an hour away). Five minutes past six AM I completed my purchase of the iPhone X, Space gray, 64 GB *with* the apple upgrade program and apple care plus. I am going to pick it up this afternoon - wish me luck.


### Notes

- Apple updates its inventory at `6:00 AM`
- If you buy your iPhone though the apple upgrade program, the person who manages your service provider account must be the one to pick up the phone.
  - They **must** have their ID

# Backgrounds

Recently I was browsing r/worldnews and saw this post:
>[NASA's $1 Billion Juno Probe Has Been Sending Back Some Jaw-Dropping Photos of Jupiter](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/7bvqnl/nasas_1_billion_juno_probe_has_been_sending_back/)

Loving space, naturally I clicked it. And wow. These photos are amazing. And they are perfect for backgrounds. [Here](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/juno/images/index.html) is the full gallery if you want to take a look.

# Remap Your Keyboard

Do you use your *caps lock* key? Either way, you may want to consider remapping it. Especially if you have the new MacBook Pro with touch bar, the *escape* key is really hard to hit. Here is what I do, I have my *caps lock* key set to be *escape* when it is pressed alone and *shift+control+option+command* when pressed with another key. Then I have my windows mapped to those keys, so for example when I want to line up chrome in the space I have set aside fore it, I just hit *caps lock+C*.

### How To

1. [Download Karabiner](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/) and install it.
2. Open "Karabiner-Elements" and click the "Complex Modifications" tab.
3. Click "Add rule" and then "Import more rules from the Internet...".
4. Import the second option "Change caps_lock key".
5. Enable "Change caps_lock key to command+control+option+shift. (Post escape key when pressed alone)" in Karabiner.

### Windows Manager

Most windows managers will be able to do this. The windows managers that I use are the combination of [Magnet](http://magnet.crowdcafe.com/) and [Optimal Layout](http://most-advantageous.com/optimal-layout/).

# Hello World

Lets start up this blog! This is the first post. Its mostly just a test. Later today I will write my *actual* first post. Just for kicks, here is a Steve Jobs quote:

> Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life.
