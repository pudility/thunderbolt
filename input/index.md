# The iPhone X
...one day later

I have had the iPhone for one day now, so treat this less like a review and more like a *first impressions*.

### Moving from Android
The process of moving from my Pixel 2 XL was surprisingly smooth. I used the [Move to iOS app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.apple.movetoios&hl=en) and it moved over all of my contacts, messages, and even some of my apps. I then installed the whole google sweet of apps (most of which where not optimized yet ðŸ˜¦). Everything worked like a charm, all my data was exactly where I had left it on my Android phone. The best part of all was that the whole process only took about half an hour. I then spent the rest of the night downloading new apps, and logging into them. Another difference between iOS and Android that I noticed is that 1Password works *so* much better. This made logging into my apps pretty easy.

### My Favorite Apps
Another difference that I noticed right off the bat is that in general, *iOS apps are just better than Android apps*. At first when people would say that Android apps were bad or anti-intuitive, I would not believe them. But now I see what they are saying! I even feel like some of the google apps work better on my iPhone.

I have been enjoying a lot of the third party apps especially overcast which is a **huge** step up from my previous podcast app [Podcast Addict](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bambuna.podcastaddict&hl=en).

### iMessage
iMessage is amazing. It is a huge step up from Android messenger. I love all the extra features, like knowing when messages are delivered and read. I also like all the in-message apps like 8 Ball and Cup Pong. Stickers, GIFs, and animoji are also lots of fun (though I have not found myself using animoji as much as I thought I would).

### What I *Love*
The top of my list for best things about this phone is defiantly the build quality. It is like no Android phone period. Not even the Galaxy S8, which I would *think* should have a similar build quality. The extra 5mm on either side of the display actually make it look *a lot* better than the pixel, and so far the battery life has been just fine.

Next I would say that the OS is very smooth. I do have some problems with the it, but I will talk about those next. I like the gestures (especially the previous app gesture) and everything feels like it has a place and works. I have only found one thing that seemed slightly broken (magnification) and I think this was due to user error and not the OS.

3D touch is also great. I like how you can press things harder to dig deeper into their settings, or get shortcuts.

Lastly, this phone feels lightning fast. It never freezes or randomly quits apps. It had no problem installing lots of apps very quickly, or moving 9GB worth of photos. Another great feature that I have taken advantage of is that iOS closes background apps without you having to do anything.

### What I wish they would change
- Defaults. I wish I could set default apps like chrome as my default web browser (even though it would still have to use webkit) or Inbox as my default mail app.

- Notifications. I really loved the way Android handles notifications, I wish iOS did something similar. I would also like my notifications to appear under control center, so I could just keep scrolling and see them.

- Always on Display. I really liked my Pixel's always on display. Especially with these new AMOLED displays, I think this would be a great feature.

- Back Button. I find myself constantly trying to use the swipe to most recent app gesture when trying to go back to the previous window of an app. I think it would be cool if they incorporated this as a feature.

- Launcher. Even though multi touch allows you to move multiple apps across your home screen at once, I still find it very hard to organize my home screen. I also liked how the Pixel Launcher allowed you to have white space and widgets (though I do not mind only having widgets on the far left window of the home/lock screen). But the thing I miss most about the Pixel Launcher is only having about a dozen apps out on my home screen and the rest in a drawer alphabetically organized with the five most commonly used at the top.

# iPhone Day

Today is iPhone day for me. Most people got their iPhones last week, but last week I did not have the slightest idea I event wanted an iPhone. Before two days ago I had an android phone; More specifically I had the google pixel 2 xl, before that I had the original pixel and before that I had the onePlus. But my android stories are for another day. The reason I decided to switch to IOS is because of the iPhone X. My friend got one and let me use it - I immediately fell in love. I have a mac and an iPad, so IOS is not completely foreign to me. However I do not know all the ins and outs of the OS and I am *so* excited to learn more.

### Yesterday

Yesterday my friend and I went to the apple store near my house. We got their an hour early and waited for the doors to open - it was definitely overkill but I was determined to buy the iPhone before anyone else who may have wanted it. Unfortunately they did not have any for iPhones available for walk-in purchase in order to prevent scalping (read more about that [here](https://www.macrumors.com/2017/11/03/iphone-x-seattle/)). Then I tried several times to purchase it from the website and apple store app only to end up calling apple and purchasing it over phone. When I finally purchased it I was again disappointed to find out that the only "trusted person" (the only person that is allowed to pick up your iPhone) was not me, but my Verizon account manager. After calling apple twice and fiddling around with the terrible "My Verizon" app I was finally able to make myself the Account manager - Unfortunately this did not effect the name on the trusted persons list. At this point I was ever so slightly irritated, so I went home and canceled my order.

### Today

Today I woke up at `5:45 AM` in order to be the first one to reserve the iPhone at the apple store *near my house* (not the one at South Center almost an hour away). Five minutes past six AM I completed my purchase of the iPhone X, Space gray, 64 GB *with* the apple upgrade program and apple care plus. I am going to pick it up this afternoon - wish me luck.


### Notes

- Apple updates its inventory at `6:00 AM`
- If you buy your iPhone though the apple upgrade program, the person who manages your service provider account must be the one to pick up the phone.
  - They **must** have their ID

# Backgrounds

Recently I was browsing r/worldnews and saw this post:
>[NASA's $1 Billion Juno Probe Has Been Sending Back Some Jaw-Dropping Photos of Jupiter](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/7bvqnl/nasas_1_billion_juno_probe_has_been_sending_back/)

Loving space, naturally I clicked it. And wow. These photos are amazing. And they are perfect for backgrounds. [Here](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/juno/images/index.html) is the full gallery if you want to take a look.

# Drones

Recently I got into drone flying. Now, even though I am not very good, it is one of my favorite pass times. I got the parts for my quad from [Armattan](http://www.armattanquads.com/). I got the [Armadillo model](http://www.armattanquads.com/armadillo-1/), it is one of the most compact `5"` drones out there. I paired it with the [Turnigy Evolution](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/fpv-racer-radio-mode-2-black.html?___store=en_us) receiver. I like this receiver because it is super simple, feels great to hold, and looks amazing.

### Practice

If you try flying an FPV drone, you will quickly realize that it is **a lot** harder than it looks. I recommend that you try a simulator in order to practice your skills. I use the Drone Racing League Simulator, is not very realistic but it gets the job done and is really good for a free app.

### Armattan

If you end up getting a drone, I highly recommend Armattan. They will give you parts or they can also build it for you. They test to make sure everything is working, and they can customize every drone with special requests. I had an *amazing* experience.

### Props

Get lots of them. They will inevitably break.

As for what props you should buy, [@drill_on](https://www.reddit.com/user/Drill_on) sums it up pretty well in their [post on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Multicopter/comments/2vl1wb/whats_the_difference_between_different_types_of/coimhsj/):
>Plastic props have different level of flex to them. This can be a problem for a number of reason, flex allows for more vibration creation, flex can allow them to hit the frame in small clearances. Flex means decreased lift during that flex, likely when your maneuvering and want it most.
Glass fiber reinforced are mid stiffness mid strength

The only thing that they left out is that glass fiber props break *a lot* more easily.

# Remap Your Keyboard

Do you use your *caps lock* key? Either way, you may want to consider remapping it. Especially if you have the new MacBook Pro with touch bar, the *escape* key is really hard to hit. Here is what I do, I have my *caps lock* key set to be *escape* when it is pressed alone and *shift+control+option+command* when pressed with another key. Then I have my windows mapped to those keys, so for example when I want to line up chrome in the space I have set aside fore it, I just hit *caps lock+C*.

### How To

1. [Download Karabiner](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/) and install it.
2. Open "Karabiner-Elements" and click the "Complex Modifications" tab.
3. Click "Add rule" and then "Import more rules from the Internet...".
4. Import the second option "Change caps_lock key".
5. Enable "Change caps_lock key to command+control+option+shift. (Post escape key when pressed alone)" in Karabiner.

### Windows Manager

Most windows managers will be able to do this. The windows managers that I use are the combination of [Magnet](http://magnet.crowdcafe.com/) and [Optimal Layout](http://most-advantageous.com/optimal-layout/).

# Hello World

Lets start up this blog! This is the first post. Its mostly just a test. Later today I will write my *actual* first post. Just for kicks, here is a Steve Jobs quote:

> Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life.
