# Drones

Recently I got into drone flying. Now, even though I am not very good, it is one of my favorite pass times. I got the parts for my quad from [Armattan](http://www.armattanquads.com/). I got the [Armadillo model](http://www.armattanquads.com/armadillo-1/), it is one of the most compact `5"` drones out there. I paired it with the [Turnigy Evolution](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/fpv-racer-radio-mode-2-black.html?___store=en_us) receiver. I like this receiver because it is super simple, feels great to hold, and looks amazing.

### Practice

If you try flying an FPV drone, you will quickly realize that it is **a lot** harder than it looks. I recommend that you try a simulator in order to practice your skills. I use the Drone Racing League Simulator, is not very realistic but it gets the job done and is really good for a free app.

### Armattan

If you end up getting a drone, I highly recommend Armattan. They will give you parts or they can also build it for you. They test to make sure everything is working, and they can customize every drone with special requests. I had an *amazing* experience.

### Props

Get lots of them. They will inevitably break.

As for what props you should buy, [@drill_on](https://www.reddit.com/user/Drill_on) sums it up pretty well in their [post on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Multicopter/comments/2vl1wb/whats_the_difference_between_different_types_of/coimhsj/):
>Plastic props have different level of flex to them. This can be a problem for a number of reason, flex allows for more vibration creation, flex can allow them to hit the frame in small clearances. Flex means decreased lift during that flex, likely when your maneuvering and want it most.
Glass fiber reinforced are mid stiffness mid strength

The only thing that they left out is that glass fiber props break *a lot* more easily.
