Recently I was browsing r/worldnews and saw this post:
>[NASA's $1 Billion Juno Probe Has Been Sending Back Some Jaw-Dropping Photos of Jupiter](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/7bvqnl/nasas_1_billion_juno_probe_has_been_sending_back/)

Loving space, naturally I clicked it. And wow. These photos are amazing. And they are perfect for backgrounds. [Here](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/juno/images/index.html) is the full gallery if you want to take a look.
