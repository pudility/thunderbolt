# Remap Your Keyboard

Do you use your *caps lock* key? Either way, you may want to consider remapping it. Especially if you have the new MacBook Pro with touch bar, the *escape* key is really hard to hit. Here is what I do, I have my *caps lock* key set to be *escape* when it is pressed alone and *shift+control+option+command* when pressed with another key. Then I have my windows mapped to those keys, so for example when I want to line up chrome in the space I have set aside fore it, I just hit *caps lock+C*.

### How To

1. [Download Karabiner](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/) and install it.
2. Open "Karabiner-Elements" and click the "Complex Modifications" tab.
3. Click "Add rule" and then "Import more rules from the Internet...".
4. Import the second option "Change caps_lock key".
5. Enable "Change caps_lock key to command+control+option+shift. (Post escape key when pressed alone)" in Karabiner.

### Windows Manager

Most windows managers will be able to do this. The windows managers that I use are the combination of [Magnet](http://magnet.crowdcafe.com/) and [Optimal Layout](http://most-advantageous.com/optimal-layout/).
