# Tales of an Android User
<!-- This is disabled until after I write some other stuff, it will be the third blog post -->

I have been using Android for 3 years. There are goods and bads. In this post I am going to highlight my favorite and least favorite parts of android, and what you should expect. This will probably be a longer article.

### History of my Android Life

I originally bought the onePlus X for a couple of reasons. One of the biggest reasons is that is was the most phone you could get for your money. At the time it was a high-end android phone running almost-stalk android for only $300. Its display, batter life and build quality was very premium (its build quality impresses me to this day and is probably still better than that of the Pixel sires).

After the OnePlus X I debated getting the OnePlus 3, but decided against it because of the size (I wanted a smaller phone). So I ended up getting the pixel. The battery life and OS where great and it was the first phone to ship with the Gooogle Assistant. The downside was that the build quality had some room for improvement. This was also my first phone to have a finger print reader - this was one of my favorite features. I especially liked the placement of the fingerprint reader. I know that lots of people disagree with me on this, but I find it incredibly convenient because >95% of the time I already had my finger there anyway. This was definitely the smartest phone I had ever had, and I loved it dearly.

I had such a good experience with the Google Pixel that I decided to buy the Pixel 2. This time I went for the XL because of the screen real-estate. This phone was a seamless transition from the Google Pixel. It took me less than half an hour to switch from one to the other, and everything was the way it was on the previous phone; all the settings, backgrounds, app placements - it was all there. Given that it was Android 8, I also had auto-fill, so there was limited back and forth between apps and 1Password. The camera on this phone was great, and so was the squeeze feature. The squeeze feature is possibly the most underrated feature of this phone. Another great thing about the Google Pixel 2 XL was the forward facing speakers, they where loud and clear. All of this being said, the absolute best part of this phone was the Google Assistant, it was build it... optimies... <explain more> However the phone did have its faults. One of the main ones being the fingerprint sensor. I am not sure if it was just the way I set it up or what, but it felt like a real down-grade from the original pixel. Another downside was the build quality, for more than $900 this phone did not hold a candle to the iPhone's build quality, or even to the Galaxy S8. Another thing that prompted me to switch is the Android OS itself. Don't get me wrong - I am definently and android enthusiast. I love to get the betas and try out all their new features; however I **never** try them on my primary device. When I got the Pixel 2 XL out of the box, it came with Android 8; I never updated it's software. However I kept running into things that should have been cleared up in the beta. Things like apps randomly stopping, the display freezing up, and random vibrations that I could not link to anything. Even though Android O had a lot of amazing features, it almost felt like a downgrade in reliability form Android 7. Lastly, the thing that really pissed me off more than anything else was the phone app. The phone app is the one thing a phone should do if nothing else - it is even in the name! However 9 times out of ten the phone app would not ring or when I tried to answer a phone call it would immediately hang up. I ended up downloading an older phone app APK (something you can do on android), but that is besides the point, I should not have to download my own phone app - it should just work. All of these things combined made me give the iPhone another shot.

##### Galaxy S8

As part of a project, I built my own Galaxy S8. I used it for about a week before selling it because of incompatibility with Verizon. Maybe I will write about it sometime.

### What you Should Expect

There is **a lot** of variation in the android phone you buy, and it is not just quality variation. There is variation in the OS, the build quality, the virtual assistance the reliability, the customer service - everything.

As I said above, my most recent android phone was the Google Pixel 2 Xl (what a mouth-full). This is (in my opinion) the way to go if you want an android device. You might get a better build quality or display with Samsung, but the most important thing for android is the OS, and google controls that (for the most part). The pixel has the smoothes, cleanest, and most reliable OS. Even though all android phones run Android, there is a fair amount of customizability that has to go into the OSs to make them even work on the phones at all. Given that in the case of the Google Pixel sires google makes both the hardware and the software - the Pixels often come out the most well rounded.

#### Samsung OS/GUI

Samsung created their own GUI called touch-wiz. this is shit and I will talk about why.
